Another in my series of birthday songs. This was inspired by a "Jake and the
Neverland Pirates" seventh birthday party theme.

> ## Birthday Party Pirates
>
> I want to be a pirate  
> Headed out to sea.  
> I just turned seven  
> I'm sure that I am ready!
>
> I want to be a pirate  
> Maybe first mate.  
> Don't want to be a scallywag  
> Who's forced to walk the plank!
>
> Yo, ho, ho!
>
> I don't want to be a parrot,  
> But a pirate lass.  
> I want to wear an eyepatch  
> And have my own spyglass.
>
> I want to be a pirate,  
> Mean as can be.  
> Don't want to be a fireman  
> Saving cats from trees.
>
> Yo, ho, ho!
>
> Yo, ho, ho, we're the birthday party pirates!  
> Yo, ho, yo! (Yo, ho, yo!)  
> Yo, ho, ho, we're the birthday party pirates!  
> Yo, ho, yo! (Yo, ho, yo!)
>
> I say yo, you say ho, ho!  
> Yo! (Ho, ho!) Yo! (Ho, ho!)  
> I say yo, you say ho, ho!  
> Yo! (Ho, ho!) Yo! (Ho, ho!)
>
> Yo, ho, ho, we're the birthday party pirates!  
> Yo, ho, yo! (Yo, ho, yo!)  
> Yo, ho, ho, we're the birthday party pirates!  
> Yo, ho, yo! (Yo, ho, yo!)
>
> Yo, ho, ho, happy birthday to you!  
> Yo, ho, yo! (Yo, ho, yo!)  
> Yo, ho, ho, happy birthday to you!  
> Yo, ho, yo! (Yo, ho, yo!)
