A million years ago, I mashed-up the Flickr search API and an ASCII-art
version of Tux the penguin. The images from the search were mapped onto the
ASCII image and gradually made visible. The results were also used to produce
random MIDI audio. It was really pretty simple, conceptually, but also geeky
and cool.

I wanted to revisit the idea now that browsers are starting to implement the
[Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/).

The original was called Pixels to Penguins. This new version is
[pixels2015](http://aronatkins.github.io/pixels2015/).
