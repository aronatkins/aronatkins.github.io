A million years ago, I mashed-up the Flickr search API and an ASCII-art
version of Tux the penguin. I called it "Pixels to Penguins". The images from
the search were mapped onto the ASCII image and gradually made visible. The
results were also used to produce random MIDI audio. It was really pretty
simple, conceptually, but also geeky and cool.

I wanted to revisit the idea now that browsers are starting to implement the
[Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/).

The new version is called
[pixels2015](http://aronatkins.github.io/pixels2015/). The source is in a
[GitHub](https://github.com)
[repository](https://github.com/aronatkins/pixels2015/tree/gh-pages).

Update (2016-09-16): The video of my presentation at BarCampBoston2 is now
available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xpEw14P6pIQ).
