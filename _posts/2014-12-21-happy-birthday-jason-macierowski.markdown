I have started to form this habit of writing songs for birthdays. My friend
[Ben](https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/ben) turned 40, and a song emerged.
His son had a birthday on March 14, so I wrote about
[pie](https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/pie).

As soon as I heard that one of my
[closest friends was throwing himself a birthday bash/concert](http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH),
inspiration struck. I'm not sure that I've ever written a song with so many
lyrics!

Jason and I have a ton of history. We met our sophmore year at
[Cathedral](http://www.cathedralhigh.org), and have remained friends since. We
went to college at [WPI](http://wpi.edu) together and were briefly roommates.
Our first band, Tintern Abbey, gave him the 'tintern' moniker he has used ever
since. All through college, we were the core of
[jaded](http://gweep.net/~jaded).

It's hard for me to find a way to express just how much I value our
friendship. This song tells our story and it is my present to Jason for his
fortieth birthday.

> ## Growing Up
>
> We met just a shade before fifteen,  
> Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.  
> Our band was Tintern Abbey.  
> We had no fans, we played so badly.
>
> And we just keep growing up.
>
> I learned to drive long before you.  
> Took my mom's caravan to high school.  
> I remember your escort wagon,  
> Fearing for my life in the way back.
>
> And we just keep growing up.
>
> We went to a Chili Pepper concert.  
> Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.  
> Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,  
> Long before they had their big hit.
>
> And we just keep growing up.
>
> We went to college and lived together.  
> Didn't last much past October.  
> You were always, "Open the blinds, please!"  
> as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.
>
> And we just keep growing up.
>
> Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.  
> Made a tape called, "What happens behind closed doors".  
> Back then we were bitter like coffee,  
> Playing all night at Eleni's Midnight Cafe.
>
> And we just keep growing up.
>
> I got hitched and you were my best man,  
> Even though your hair had a skunk tan.  
> Your toast was absolutely perfect.  
> We saved that bread! It's somewhere in the basement.
>
> And we just keep growing up.
>
> And now it's time to say happy birthday,  
> Even though you threw your own party.  
> Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,  
> you're forty years old.
>
> And we just keep growing up.
