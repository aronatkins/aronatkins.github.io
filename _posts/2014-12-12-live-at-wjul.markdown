Back in 1999, I did a solo performance on the WJUL radio show of
[Duct Tape Boy](http://centeroftheearth.us/info.php) (Matthew Mittelstadt).
Even now, 15 years later, I am really proud of that session and super thankful
that I was given the opportunity.

I have had the WJUL recordings occasionally online; they are again available
on my [music site](http://gweep.net/~aron/music).

[My SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins) also has the complete
[*Live @ WJUL*](https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/sets/live-at-wjul) album.
