Yesterday, [GitHub](https://github.com) published
[their guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request)
for collaborating with pull requests. I love this.

I have written about my
[code review philosophy and guidelines](/2014/12/13/hey-buddy.html) in the
past. The GitHub guide captures much of the same advice and also includes a
few practical tips when using the
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) and
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

The GitHub guidelines were inspired by Thoughtbot's
[code review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review)
guide.
