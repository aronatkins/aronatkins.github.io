I have had a distaste for the
[Lego Friends](http://www.lego.com/en-us/friends) collections ever since I
first encountered them. They've created a specialty brand of Lego toys that
caters to the Disney Princess set. What I don't understand is why they
couldn't have added more gender balance to their existing sets.

This [webcomic](http://seasonaldepressioncomic.com/2014/12/06/lego-friends/)
made the [rounds](http://www.marco.org/2014/12/17/lego-friends) this week and
suggests an alternative approach that I have long thought made sense.

Lego has always had tons of castles. Add princesses and sword maidens. Create
Joan of Arc. Scatter women across all the collections and all the sets. Show
us that Lego women, like real women, can do anything.

There are some sets, especially in their
[Creator](http://www.lego.com/en-us/creator) and
[City](http://www.lego.com/en-us/city) lines which do a better job at having
women and girls represented. Our family seeks out these more balanced kits.

The [Research Institute](http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Research-Institute-21110)
set was amazing and, unfortunately, a surprise. Lego, please give us a world
where we are no longer surprised by a kit with three women participating in
scientific endeavors.
