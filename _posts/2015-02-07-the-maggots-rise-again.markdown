Another birthday, another song. Last year, I wrote
"[Ben](https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/ben)". This year is not much
different, as I wrote a song about maggots again. We debuted the song last
night at Ben's birthday party (with kids dancing and singing the "All for
one!" maggot parts). It sounds so much better with a chorus of kids!

> ## The Maggots Rise Again
> 
> The last time we talked, I asked about your maggots, Ben.  
> Have they gone a travelin', to Paris or Berlin?
> 
> "Oh, no!", you say, "Galapagos!, A family holiday."  
> "With me and Tim and Xine and Cole, even Poppy came."
> 
> But what about your wriggly friends, the ones below your knee?  
> Were they content to stay at home and not accompany,
> 
> Or did they sit and stew and vent and write a pithy tune?  
> I think they did. I'll sing it now for you.
> 
> All for one, one for all.  
> You're forty-one, we're not tall.  
> You're getting old, we'll stay small.  
> The maggots rise again!
> 
> All for one, one for all.  
> You're forty-one, we're not tall.  
> You're getting old, we'll stay small.  
> The maggots who saved Ben!
> 
> All for one, one for all.  
> You're forty-one, we're not tall.  
> You're getting old, we'll stay small.  
> The maggots sing again!
> 
> All for one, one for all.  
> You're forty-one, we're not tall.  
> You're getting old, we'll stay small.  
> Happy Birthday, Ben.
