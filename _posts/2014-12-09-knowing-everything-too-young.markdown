[*Knowing Everything Too Young*](http://aronatkins.github.io/too-young/) is a
book of poetry written by my sister, Cristina. Back in 1998, I published a
small print run of this book with the help of my
[brother-in-law](http://robertsprinting.com). I also put the contents online.
She received the printed books and the website as a Christmas gift that year.

Unfortunately, that old online location is no longer around, but I am happy to
make the book [available again](http://aronatkins.github.io/too-young/).

Other than removing a few obsolete links, the content is unmodified. `<TABLE>`
and `<CENTER>` tags for layout; global style inside the `<BODY>` tag; a very
dark, gloomy color scheme. I love it.
