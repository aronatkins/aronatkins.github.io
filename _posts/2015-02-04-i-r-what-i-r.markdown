I am two days late in posting about it, but as of
[Groundhog Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day), I have rejoined
the ranks of the employed.

I am a part of the team at [RStudio](http://rstudio.com), joining a number of
former [Brightcove](http://brightcove.com) colleagues. 

As typical with new jobs, there's a ton to learn: R and all its accompanying
ecosystem, Angular, Bootstrap, Go. All this newness can be a bit intimidating,
but I also find it invigorating -- my eagerness to dig in and deeply
understand all these new things drives me forward.

My first day was a snow day, the result of Boston's most recent winter
pummeling. So much of what RStudio creates is open and available in public
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/rstudio/); I could easily get started
in between shoveling breaks.

I love my blurb from the [RStudio about](http://rstudio.com/about) page:

I'm glad to be promoting my love for apple cider donuts. It probably deserves
a blog post of its own!
