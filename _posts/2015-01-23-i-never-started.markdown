I am a non-drinker.

I get asked, "Why?" and feel like I never have a clear answer.

When I was younger, I went to a [high school](http://www.cathedralhigh.org)
several towns away and lived quite a distance from most of my friends. Our
parents would always drive to get-togethers. I also
[worked](http://www.atkinsfarms.com) many evenings and weekends. School, band,
work, and lots of driving. I was busy.

Even at occasions where alcohol was available, it never felt like the right
thing to do.

College saw me wasting time making [music](http://gweep.net/~jaded/) and
[MUDding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) and
[detecting](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Wire/Spring96/students.html)
[submarines](http://www.wpi.edu/News/TechNews/960326/Math.html) and
[path-finding](http://www.pme-math.org/journal/issues/PMEJ.Vol.10.No.4.pdf)
(search for my name) and
[counting things](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gsarkozy/Cikkek/11.pdf). Lots of
folks start drinking during their college years, but for me, it felt like my
path was already set.

I came across this gem of a quote from
[John D. Rockefeller](https://books.google.com/books?id=Mleb5acWQF4C&lpg=PA190&ots=fRosKdtDHQ&dq=%22do%20you%20know%20why%20i%20never%20became%20a%20drunkard%22&pg=PA190#v=onepage&q=%22do%20you%20know%20why%20i%20never%20became%20a%20drunkard%22&f=false)
in a recent Paul Graham post about startups and [corporate development](http://www.paulgraham.com/corpdev.html):

> Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  
> Because I never took the **first** drink.

I could look back at my life and come up with lots of little reasons which
explain why I don't drink.

The simplest answer: I never started.
