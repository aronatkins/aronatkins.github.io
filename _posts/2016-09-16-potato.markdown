Inspiration can strike at the oddest times.

Tonight, my daughter asked if I had written a song I had been playing after
dinner. It's something that's unfinished because parts of it were just humming
and la-la-la.

"How do you write a song?" For me, I always start by messing around on the
guitar (or tonight, the ukulele) until I've got something I like. I start
humming over the guitar to find a tune and then I try and find words that
match the melody in my head. Sometimes I have an idea or a phrase that I want
to fit in, but it almost always starts with the music.

I wrote this song to show how it works.

> Sometimes, I feel like a potato  
> All covered with dirt.  
> My eyes are always filled with soil  
> No, it don't hurt.  
> I wait around for a shovel,  
> To come and dig me up.  
> I'm going to go swim in some oil,  
> And I'll be, and I'll be your french fry for your dinner.  
> I'll be the french fry you'll love.  
> I'll be a french fry for your dinner.  
> I'll be a french fry for you.
