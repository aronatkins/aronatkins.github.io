Last night was
[Jason's birthday bash/concert](http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH).
We had a fun night in Worcester at [Ralph's](http://www.ralphsrockdiner.com)
listening to good music and catching up with old friends.

I jumped on-stage and performed
'[Growing Up](http://aronatkins.github.io/2014/12/21/happy-birthday-jason-macierowski.html)'
before Jason's band
[The Rusty Shovels](https://www.facebook.com/therustyshovels) played their
set.

We captured an iPhone recording of my performance.

Thanks so much to all of The Rusty Shovels for letting me crash their party
and serenade Jason with his birthday song.
