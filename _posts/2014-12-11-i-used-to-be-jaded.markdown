In college, I was part of a band called [jaded](http://gweep.net/~jaded). We
started off as a trio, were briefly a quartet, but for most of our history
were a duo: [me](http://gweep.net/~aron) singing and playing guitar and
[Jason](http://webpages.charter.net/tintern/) playing either bass or
electronic drums.

We recorded with Tascam cassette recorders, mastered onto cassette, and have
no playable copies of our first two albums.

I do have electronic copies of our final studio album,
[*Breathe*](http://gweep.net/~jaded/breathe.shtml), from 1995 and our
remix/live album
[*Sister in the Corner*](http://gweep.net/~jaded/sister-in-the-corner.shtml),
from 1998. Both are now available for download from the
[jaded](http://gweep.net/~jaded) site.
