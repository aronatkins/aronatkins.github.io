Here's a fragment of a song written because one of my friends <a
href="http://wpi.edu">from college</a> and I were joking on Facebook about
starting a band together. Unfortunately, she doesn't live that close to me.

I decided to write about the distance between us and if technology
could bridge that gap. I thought about writing more, but somehow, the
simple repetition feels just right. 

This is a bit of an experiment for me, as I decided to overdub harmonies. It's
not a perfect effort, but hopefully gets the effect across.
