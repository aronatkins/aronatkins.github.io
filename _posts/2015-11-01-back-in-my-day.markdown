Stop the presses! Sound the bells! I've written (finished, not just another
fragment) a song that's not tied to someone's birthday!

> ## Back in My Day
>
> Back in my day  
> I was the one who got picked on the most  
> Chased home from school by the boys who boast  
> That they could ruin my day
>
> Back in my day  
> I turned around and gave them what for  
> And they didn't bother me no more  
> Way back in my day
>
> I don't know how you can sit up there  
> And drink your mountain air  
> I'm doing fine down on the ground  
> Living life  
> Like back in my day
>
> Back in my day  
> I worked the farm from the age of ten  
> Earning two dollars an hour then  
> Trying to pinch and save
>
> Back in my day  
> I followed Dad just to learn the trade  
> Out to Niagara and back again  
> Way back in my day
>
> I don't know how you can sit up there  
> And drink your mountain air  
> I'm doing fine down on the ground  
> Living life  
> Like back in my day
>
> Back in my day  
> We used to all play outside  
> Without our parents helicoptering by  
>
> Back in my day  
> The geeks weren't cool  
> We just tried to survive
>
> I don't know how you can sit up there  
> And drink your mountain air  
> I'm doing fine down on the ground  
> Living life  
> Like back in my day  
> Back in my day  
> Back in my old man day
