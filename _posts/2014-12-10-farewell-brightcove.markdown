Today is two weeks after my last day at Brightcove. My seven-and-a-half year
journey was filled with growth, challenges, scale, and a wonderful team.

As is customary, I sent a departure letter to a number of my colleagues. To
those who did not receive the note, I apologize for the oversight. Here it is;
the message applies to everyone with whom I shared the Brightcove experience.

> Subject: Seven years of thanks<br/>
> Date: 2014-11-26
>
> I often say that scale is humbling. Most times we speak in terms of our
> services -- of storage or streams or player traffic. These things reveal
> massive numbers that send the mind spinning.
>
> More humbling is how we have scaled as people, as teams, and as a company.
> We are always solving bigger, harder, more important problems while
> reinforcing our foundation: a culture of respect and personal
> responsibility.
>
> I reflect on my seven and a half year journey at Brightcove with a prideful
> glow that will not soon fade.
>
> Today, as we approach the US Thanksgiving holiday, I am thankful to have
> been given the opportunity to be humbled so many times.
>
> Please let me say good bye by saying, "Thank you."
