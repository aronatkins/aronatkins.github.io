I am Aron Atkins, a
[software developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aronatkins) and
[singer/songwriter](https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins). I grew up part of a
[farming family](http://atkinsfarms.com/) in
[Western Massachusetts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Massachusetts)
towns with crazy names like "[Belchertown](http://www.belchertown.org)", and
"[Ware](http://www.townofware.com/)." After
[high school](http://www.cathedralhigh.org/) and
[college](http://www.wpi.edu/), job opportunities drew me closer and closer to
[Boston](http://www.cityofboston.gov). I am now based in
[Arlington](http://www.arlingtonma.gov), Massachusetts writing software and
[songs](https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/).
