      <description>Knowing Everything Too Young is a book of poetry written by my sister, Cristina. Back in 1998, I published a small print run of this book with the help of my brother-in-law. I also put the contents online. She received the printed books and the website as a Christmas gift that year.
Unfortunately, that old online location is no longer around, but I am happy to make the book available again.</description>
