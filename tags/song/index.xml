      <description>Inspiration can strike at the oddest times.
Tonight, my daughter asked if I had written a song I had been playing after dinner. It&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s unfinished because parts of it were just humming and la-la-la.
&amp;ldquo;How do you write a song?&amp;rdquo; For me, I always start by messing around on the guitar (or tonight, the ukulele) until I&amp;rsquo;ve got something I like. I start humming over the guitar to find a tune and then I try and find words that match the melody in my head.</description>

      <description>Stop the presses! Sound the bells! I&amp;rsquo;ve written (finished, not just another fragment) a song that&amp;rsquo;s not tied to someone&amp;rsquo;s birthday!
  Back in My Day Back in my day
I was the one who got picked on the most
Chased home from school by the boys who boast
That they could ruin my day
Back in my day
I turned around and gave them what for
And they didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me no more</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a fragment of a song written because one of my friends from college and I were joking on Facebook about starting a band together. Unfortunately, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t live that close to me.
I decided to write about the distance between us and if technology could bridge that gap. I thought about writing more, but somehow, the simple repetition feels just right.
This is a bit of an experiment for me, as I decided to overdub harmonies.</description>

      <description>Another in my series of birthday songs. This was inspired by a &amp;ldquo;Jake and the Neverland Pirates&amp;rdquo; seventh birthday party theme.
  Birthday Party Pirates I want to be a pirate
Headed out to sea.
I just turned seven
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I am ready!
I want to be a pirate
Maybe first mate.
Don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a scallywag
Who&amp;rsquo;s forced to walk the plank!
Yo, ho, ho!</description>

      <description>Another birthday, another song. Last year, I wrote &amp;ldquo;Ben&amp;rdquo;. This year is not much different, as I wrote a song about maggots again. We debuted the song last night at Ben&amp;rsquo;s birthday party (with kids dancing and singing the &amp;ldquo;All for one!&amp;rdquo; maggot parts). It sounds so much better with a chorus of kids!
  The Maggots Rise Again The last time we talked, I asked about your maggots, Ben.</description>

      <description>Last night was Jason&amp;rsquo;s birthday bash/concert. We had a fun night in Worcester at Ralph&amp;rsquo;s listening to good music and catching up with old friends.
I jumped on-stage and performed &amp;lsquo;Growing Up&amp;lsquo; before Jason&amp;rsquo;s band The Rusty Shovels played their set.
We captured an iPhone recording of my performance.

Thanks so much to all of The Rusty Shovels for letting me crash their party and serenade Jason with his birthday song.</description>

      <description>I have started to form this habit of writing songs for birthdays. My friend Ben turned 40, and a song emerged. His son had a birthday on March 14, so I wrote about pie.
As soon as I heard that one of my closest friends was throwing himself a birthday bash/concert, inspiration struck. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written a song with so many lyrics!
Jason and I have a ton of history.</description>
