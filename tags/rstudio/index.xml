      <description>The script that I previously published to handle OSX installs has been updated to also handle installing RStudio daily desktop builds on Ubuntu Linux hosts.
You need to install either curl or wget in order to use this script. It only understands Ubuntu installation and uses dpkg to perform the install. If run as a non-root user, sudo is used when running dpkg.
You may need to follow this script with a apt-get install -f to install RStudio package dependencies (using sudo if appropriate).</description>

      <description>As a member of the team at RStudio, I install the daily build of our open source RStudio IDE almost every morning.
There are published ways to download and install these builds for Linux but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.
My main development machine is a Macbook Pro, and, well, we&amp;rsquo;re different.
After far too many iterations of &amp;ldquo;google for &amp;lsquo;rstudio daily mac&amp;rsquo; then download the DMG then mount it then copy the application to /Applications&amp;rdquo;, I put on my &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s write a script for that!</description>

      <description>I am two days late in posting about it, but as of Groundhog Day, I have rejoined the ranks of the employed.
I am a part of the team at RStudio, joining a number of former Brightcove colleagues.
As typical with new jobs, there&amp;rsquo;s a ton to learn: R and all its accompanying ecosystem, Angular, Bootstrap, Go. All this newness can be a bit intimidating, but I also find it invigorating &amp;ndash; my eagerness to dig in and deeply understand all these new things drives me forward.</description>
