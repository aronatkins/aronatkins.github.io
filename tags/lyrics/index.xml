&lt;p&gt;
    In 2014, I wrote a song called &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-happy-birthday-jason-macierowski/&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/a&gt;
    for Jason Macierowski&#39;s 40th birthday. He threw himself a party, I wrote him a
    song and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-growing-up-live/&#34;&gt;performed it live&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Shortly after his 47th birthday, in January of 2022, Jason passed away.
    The Worcester Magazine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worcestermag.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/tinternfest-celebrates-life-worcester-music-superfan-jason-macierowski/9763506002/&#34;&gt;published an
    article&lt;/a&gt;
    this week celebrating Jason&#39;s life, noting that &#34;everyone has a Jason
    story&#34;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Growing Up hints at some of our times together. This annotated version of the
song lyrics shares more of our story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;aronography&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;lyrics&#34;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We met just a shade before fifteen,&lt;br&gt;
            Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I met Jason Macierowski in the fall of 1989, when we were both
                starting our sophmore year at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Cathedral
                High School&lt;/a&gt; in Springfield, Massachusetts. The science
                wing was an extension to the main building, like a
                hitch-hiking thumb stuck onto the middle of the primary
                building&#39;s figure-8.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were part of a group of kids who tended to get to
                school quite a bit before the start of the day. We would get
                breakfast in the cafeteria, swing by our lockers, maybe do some
                homework, and then wander the halls. The science wing was part of
                our loop.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were always surprised that we never met earlier
                than our second year at Cathedral. We had many of the same
                friends and took the same classes our first year, but happened
                to be in different sections of each course. Everything changed
                our sophmore year; together in almost every period.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Our band was Tintern Abbey.&lt;br&gt;
            We had no fans, we played so badly.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The band we formed in high school was called Tintern Abbey.
                Our first performance saw us pelted by oranges thrown by our
                classmates.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                From Tintern Abbey, &lt;a href=&#34;posts/2022-05-17-from-where-came-tintern/&#34;&gt;Jason became &lt;code&gt;tintern@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
                and often used &#34;Tintern&#34; online. It was a frequent enough
                handle that some folks used that tag in person, as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I learned to drive long before you.&lt;br&gt;
            Took my mom&#39;s caravan to high school.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My birthday is in October, Jason&#39;s was December. That sounds
                like our birthdays were close together, but trust me: when
                you&#39;re sixteen waiting for the freedoms that arrive with a
                driver&#39;s license, months drag on forever!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I would sometimes drive my mother&#39;s blue &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager&#34;&gt;Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;
                to school, as I often needed to pick up orders for our store
                from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Pierce&#34;&gt;S.S. Pierce&lt;/a&gt;
                in Springfield.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                One time, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butternut_squash&#34;&gt;butternut squash&lt;/a&gt;
                rolled underneath the seat of the caravan, where it was found
                by my friends. The squash was given a face with a black marker
                and roamed the halls of Cathedral, accompanying our friend
                Jeff to many of his classes.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I remember your escort wagon,&lt;br&gt;
            Fearing for my life in the way back.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason often drove his mother&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Escort_(North_America)&#34;&gt;Ford Escort&lt;/a&gt;
                wagon to school. Yes, it had wood paneling.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                One time when driving with Jason, I ended up in the back, with
                the rear seats flat. Wherever we were headed, there was
                traffic on the road, and Jason decided to try to jump ahead by
                cutting through the parking lots of some strip malls. Jason
                did not know slow, and he did not know gradual stops. He was
                wickedly familar with abrupt cornering, however! By the time
                we got back to the main road, I was lying flat in the back
                with a hand firmly gripping each of the front head rests.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We went to a Chili Pepper concert.&lt;br&gt;
            Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My first &#34;real&#34; concert was on the 3rd of November, 1991, at
                the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MassMutual_Center&#34;&gt;Springfield Civic Center&lt;/a&gt;.
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam&#34;&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins&#34;&gt;The Smashing Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt; opened for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers&#34;&gt;Red
                Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Pearl Jam was almost unknown at the time, as &#34;Ten&#34; had just
                been released. I think that Jason had known of them before the
                show, but I went in cold. The Smashing Pumpkins were
                supporting &#34;Gish&#34;, and were the strongest draw for me and
                Jason. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were the headliner, touring
                to support the just-released &#34;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&#34;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                It felt as if all three bands were growing up, maturing, and
                finding themselves &amp;mdash; just as Jason and I were also learning
                who we were.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,&lt;br&gt;
            Long before they had their big hit.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;       
            &lt;p&gt;
                We &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing&#34;&gt;moshed&lt;/a&gt;.
                Things were never violent in the pit, but as the crowd surged,
                my glasses were knocked from my face; landing on the floor. I
                still cannot believe that I found them again and that they
                were undamaged.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We went to college and lived together.&lt;br&gt;
            Didn&#39;t last much past October.&lt;br&gt;
            You were always, &#34;Open the blinds, please!&#34;&lt;br&gt;
            as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I both applied and were accepted, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_decision&#34;&gt;early decision&lt;/a&gt;,
                to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wpi.edu/&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;. We lived together our first year, on the first floor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wpi.edu/about/locations/sanford-riley-hall&#34;&gt;Sanford Riley Hall&lt;/a&gt;.
                WPI was pressed for housing, as our tiny double had previously
                served as a single.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason&#39;s bass amp (later named &#34;Ed&#34;) became part of our wake-up
                routine. My clock radio had a tape deck that could be
                programmed as a scheduled alarm. It also had an auxilliary
                out. The radio was wired to the bass amp, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imqvLToWH7k&#34;&gt;Ministry&#39;s N.W.O.&lt;/a&gt; ready to go.
                We were guaranteed to make our 8AM classes!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Before half the year was up, I swapped rooms with someone else
                on our floor. Small things, like closing the curtains when
                dressing, caused friction.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.&lt;br&gt;
            Made a tape called, &#34;What happens behind closed doors&#34;.&lt;br&gt;
            Back then we were bitter like coffee,&lt;br&gt;
            Playing all night at Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were in a number of bands together, starting with Tintern Abbey. &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/&#34;&gt;Jaded&lt;/a&gt; started
                soon after we arrived at WPI. It was initially Jason, me
                (Aron), and our friend Dan, who lived across the hall. We
                couldn&#39;t bring ourselves to call the band &#34;J.A.D.&#34;, and &#34;Jade&#34;
                was an R&amp;amp;B band at the time. We decided to name Jason&#39;s
                bass amp &#34;Ed&#34;. Jaded was Jason, Aron, Dan, and Ed the bass
                amp.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Brian, another of our friends, joined Jaded for a while, but
                it eventually ended up as a duo: me and Jason. I sang and
                played acoustic guitar. Jason started off playing bass before
                buying an electric drum kit.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason handled all of our recording. We borrowed four-track and
                eight-track cassette recorders from friends until Jason got
                his own.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                In 1993, we &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/behind-closed-doors.shtml&#34;&gt;recorded an album&lt;/a&gt; called
                &#34;What Happens Behind Closed Doors&#34;. The cassette B-side was a
                collection of remixes called &#34;The Bitter Like Coffee
                Sessions&#34;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jaded performed a number of times at WPI and around Worcester,
                but our absolute favorite place was Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe
                (RIP). We would perform for an entire evening at Eleni&#39;s,
                sometimes playing every song we knew twice or even three
                times! By the time we wrapped up and finished our coffees, it
                was early the next day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I got hitched and you were my best man,&lt;br&gt;
            Even though your hair had a skunk tan.&lt;br&gt;
            Your toast was absolutely perfect.&lt;br&gt;
            We saved that bread! It&#39;s somewhere in the basement.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason was the best man at my wedding in 2001. Unfortunately,
                he had a habit of making dramatic hair changes immediately
                before important events. In high school, Jason decided to give
                himself a buzz cut, not realizing that yearbook photos were
                the following week! For my wedding, Jason died his hair black,
                leaving only a single streak of peroxide blonde.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                As the best man, Jason gave a toast at our wedding. With his
                toast, he also gave us toast - perfectly browned and protected
                by a plastic bag. Jason&#39;s toast has been stored with a small
                number of keepsakes, ever since.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And now it&#39;s time to say happy birthday,&lt;br&gt;
            Even though you threw your own party.&lt;br&gt;
            Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,&lt;br&gt;
            you&#39;re forty years old.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;threw himself a party&lt;/a&gt;
                for his 40th birthday.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    The &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/products/connect/&#34;&gt;Connect&lt;/a&gt; team
    is occasionally asking folks to &#34;introduce yourself&#34; during our team
    meetings. I had my turn recently. I wasn&#39;t especially drawn to
    storytelling that talks through a photography slideshow. I&#39;m much more
    interested in storytelling through song. Here is my &#34;aronography&#34;, with
    annotated lyrics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;aronography&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;lyrics&#34;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton,_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;born&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974&#34;&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                Lived in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belchertown,_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Belchertown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;until the fourth grade.&lt;br&gt;

                &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Where-is-Ware-225th-Anniversary-Clown-Soft-Thin-Green-Vtg-T-Shirt-M/123726436746&#34;&gt;Ware is where&lt;/a&gt; I moved,&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;yes, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ware,_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Ware&lt;/a&gt; is the town name,&lt;br&gt;
                Just south of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quabbin_Reservoir&#34;&gt;Quabbin Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Our home in Belchertown was a short walk from one of the
                Quabbin entrances. An old road that ... disappeared
                beneath the water. During really dry years, you could see
                the foundations where buildings used to stand.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; alt=&#34;where is ware?&#34; src=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/images/where-is-ware.jpg&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                It seemed as if everyone in Ware ended up with one of these
                tshirts. This one has been listed on ebay for years! It
                appears to have been designed by one of my junior high
                classmates.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My last name is well known&lt;br&gt;
                In &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Western Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atkinsfarms.com&#34;&gt;family apple farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                Where I worked when I was underage,&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;surely I was underpaid,&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;violating labor laws!
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Growing up, everyone seemed to have a story about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atkinsfarms.com&#34;&gt;Atkins
                Farms&lt;/a&gt;. The store is near &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umass.edu&#34;&gt;UMass&lt;/a&gt;
                and was a frequent stop for visiting parents. Our cider
                donuts were amazing. In case you&#39;re asking, my favorite
                apple is the Macoun.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I started working when I was around 10, mostly office
                work, then accounting and retail.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My family has lived in New England since the 1600s.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I was in the band!&lt;br&gt;
                Marched at all the football games&lt;br&gt;
                I was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Woodman&#34;&gt;Tin Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis&#34;&gt;scoliosis&lt;/a&gt; and I grew an inch&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the day they &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/inch&#34;&gt;pulled me straight&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I started playing the alto saxophone in elementary school.
                In junior high, I switched to to the baritone saxophone.
                That beast was heavy, but I loved it. I played bari all
                through high school, including during marching season.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                One of our high school musicals was &#34;Christmas in Oz&#34;. I
                was the Tin Man, likely because I was tall. The costume
                was made of silver housing insulation. Torture under the
                stage lights!
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                I had surgery my freshman year that left a scar down my
                back.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            
            &lt;p&gt;
                My &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)&#34;&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; was
                destroyed by a tornado in 2011. A different school now
                pretends that I am an alum and asks for donations.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                At &lt;a href=&#34;https://wpi.edu/&#34;&gt;college&lt;/a&gt;, I did lots of math.&lt;br&gt;
                And before you ask,&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;it&#39;s more than adding &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anWLvZdn368&#34;&gt;2+2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
                I connected &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Loops&#34;&gt;dots and lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
                And I journeyed off to Budapest.&lt;br&gt;
                They love &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.budapestsemesters.com&#34;&gt;math in Budapest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
                I met &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdős&#34;&gt;Paul Erd&amp;#337s&lt;/a&gt; in Budapest,&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;then he died.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I went to college at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wpi.edu/&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt; in
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester%2C_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Worcester, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.
                Only 45 minutes from home, college was both &#34;close enough&#34;
                and &#34;far enough&#34;. My grandfather (the force behind the
                farm) also graduated from WPI in 1934 but returned to to
                the farm after deciding that typewriter factories weren&#39;t
                for him.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                After a long illness, &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/wjul-terminal-miracle&#34;&gt;mother passed away&lt;/a&gt; during
                my sophomore year.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Of course, &lt;em&gt;YOU&lt;/em&gt; know that it&#39;s pronounced Budapeshhhhhht!
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Paul Erd&amp;#337s gave a talk to our program one evening in
                Budapest. We were so star-struck! My &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number&#34;&gt;Erd&amp;#337s
                number&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://oakland.edu/enp/thedata/erdos2/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                I met my wife at WPI. We dated for six months, broke up
                for 5 years, and married in 2001.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                And since that day, in 1996&lt;br&gt;
                It&#39;s been more of the,&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;more of the same old same.&lt;br&gt;
                I type, type, type,&lt;br&gt;
                Then I hope and pray&lt;br&gt;
                To the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine&#34;&gt;soul of a new machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                That things go my way.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I graduated from college in 1996. Later that year, Paul
                Erd&amp;#337s passed away.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My daughter would like you to know that I do not actually
                pray and this was lazy rhyming on my part.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &#39;Cos when it all goes wrong&lt;br&gt;
                We make a million dollar rock&lt;br&gt;
                So watch the stock market crash&lt;br&gt;
                As our start ups stop&lt;br&gt;
                And the videos all glitch,&lt;br&gt;
                As the bubble goes pop!
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My first job out of college was at a company called
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chrysalis-symbolic-design&#34;&gt;Chrysalis Symbolic Design&lt;/a&gt;.
                We made software to help formally (mathematically) prove
                that a hardware design was functionally correct as it
                moved through its development. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Form&#34;&gt;proofs at work&lt;/a&gt;!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                We used to say that if our software had defects, our
                customers would waste a fabrication cycle and create what
                turned out to be million dollar rocks -- buggy chips.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My second job was at a natural language company called
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iphrase-systems&#34;&gt;iPhrase&lt;/a&gt;.
                One of our early customers was the
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schwab.com&#34;&gt;Charles Schwab&lt;/a&gt; brokerage.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I next joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/carbon-design-systems&#34;&gt;Carbon Design Systems&lt;/a&gt;,
                another software-for-hardware company. We essentially took
                hardware languages (Verilog, VHDL) and converted it into
                C++ to run simulations.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I spent about a year working with a friend on a company we called &lt;em&gt;spotstory&lt;/em&gt;.
                After that, I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightcove&#34;&gt;Brightcove&lt;/a&gt;, a video hosting company.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; at the start of 2015.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                And so I type, type, type,&lt;br&gt;
                Then I hope and pray&lt;br&gt;
                To the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tracykidder.com/the-soul-of-a-new-machine.html&#34;&gt;soul of a new machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                That things go my way.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My family has lived in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington%2C_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Arlington, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; since
                2000. My daughter (named for my mother) was born in
                2008.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;trailer&#34;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;small&gt;
                Are you looking for another song that shares these chords? You&#39;re &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx1IZnCrh78&#34;&gt;in luck&lt;/a&gt;!

                OK. That was a pretty terrible song. You really should
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew7Zkkucos8&#34;&gt;sit down&lt;/a&gt; before
                you
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWJXDG2i0A&#34;&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;/small&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Happy Birthday, Jason Macierowski!</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have started to form this habit of writing songs for birthdays. My friend
&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/ben&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; turned 40, and a song emerged.
His son had a birthday on March 14, so I wrote about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/pie&#34;&gt;pie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I heard that one of my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;closest friends was throwing himself a birthday bash/concert&lt;/a&gt;,
inspiration struck. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written a song with so many
lyrics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason and I have a ton of history. We met our sophmore year at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts)&#34;&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;,
and have remained friends since. We went to college at &lt;a href=&#34;http://wpi.edu&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;
together and were briefly roommates. Our first band, Tintern Abbey, gave him
the &amp;lsquo;tintern&amp;rsquo; moniker he has used ever since. All through college, we were the
core of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded&#34;&gt;jaded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to find a way to express just how much I value our
friendship. This song tells our story and it is my present to Jason for his
fortieth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growing-up&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met just a shade before fifteen,&lt;br /&gt;
Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.&lt;br /&gt;
Our band was Tintern Abbey.&lt;br /&gt;
We had no fans, we played so badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned to drive long before you.&lt;br /&gt;
Took my mom&amp;rsquo;s caravan to high school.&lt;br /&gt;
I remember your escort wagon,&lt;br /&gt;
Fearing for my life in the way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to a Chili Pepper concert.&lt;br /&gt;
Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.&lt;br /&gt;
Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,&lt;br /&gt;
Long before they had their big hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to college and lived together.&lt;br /&gt;
Didn&amp;rsquo;t last much past October.&lt;br /&gt;
You were always, &amp;ldquo;Open the blinds, please!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.&lt;br /&gt;
Made a tape called, &amp;ldquo;What happens behind closed doors&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Back then we were bitter like coffee,&lt;br /&gt;
Playing all night at Eleni&amp;rsquo;s Midnight Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got hitched and you were my best man,&lt;br /&gt;
Even though your hair had a skunk tan.&lt;br /&gt;
Your toast was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;
We saved that bread! It&amp;rsquo;s somewhere in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now it&amp;rsquo;s time to say happy birthday,&lt;br /&gt;
Even though you threw your own party.&lt;br /&gt;
Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,&lt;br /&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re forty years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
