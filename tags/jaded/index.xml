&lt;p&gt;
    In 2014, I wrote a song called &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-happy-birthday-jason-macierowski/&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/a&gt;
    for Jason Macierowski&#39;s 40th birthday. He threw himself a party, I wrote him a
    song and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-growing-up-live/&#34;&gt;performed it live&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Shortly after his 47th birthday, in January of 2022, Jason passed away.
    The Worcester Magazine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worcestermag.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/tinternfest-celebrates-life-worcester-music-superfan-jason-macierowski/9763506002/&#34;&gt;published an
    article&lt;/a&gt;
    this week celebrating Jason&#39;s life, noting that &#34;everyone has a Jason
    story&#34;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Growing Up hints at some of our times together. This annotated version of the
song lyrics shares more of our story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;aronography&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;lyrics&#34;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We met just a shade before fifteen,&lt;br&gt;
            Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I met Jason Macierowski in the fall of 1989, when we were both
                starting our sophmore year at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Cathedral
                High School&lt;/a&gt; in Springfield, Massachusetts. The science
                wing was an extension to the main building, like a
                hitch-hiking thumb stuck onto the middle of the primary
                building&#39;s figure-8.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were part of a group of kids who tended to get to
                school quite a bit before the start of the day. We would get
                breakfast in the cafeteria, swing by our lockers, maybe do some
                homework, and then wander the halls. The science wing was part of
                our loop.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were always surprised that we never met earlier
                than our second year at Cathedral. We had many of the same
                friends and took the same classes our first year, but happened
                to be in different sections of each course. Everything changed
                our sophmore year; together in almost every period.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Our band was Tintern Abbey.&lt;br&gt;
            We had no fans, we played so badly.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The band we formed in high school was called Tintern Abbey.
                Our first performance saw us pelted by oranges thrown by our
                classmates.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                From Tintern Abbey, &lt;a href=&#34;posts/2022-05-17-from-where-came-tintern/&#34;&gt;Jason became &lt;code&gt;tintern@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
                and often used &#34;Tintern&#34; online. It was a frequent enough
                handle that some folks used that tag in person, as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I learned to drive long before you.&lt;br&gt;
            Took my mom&#39;s caravan to high school.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My birthday is in October, Jason&#39;s was December. That sounds
                like our birthdays were close together, but trust me: when
                you&#39;re sixteen waiting for the freedoms that arrive with a
                driver&#39;s license, months drag on forever!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I would sometimes drive my mother&#39;s blue &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager&#34;&gt;Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;
                to school, as I often needed to pick up orders for our store
                from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Pierce&#34;&gt;S.S. Pierce&lt;/a&gt;
                in Springfield.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                One time, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butternut_squash&#34;&gt;butternut squash&lt;/a&gt;
                rolled underneath the seat of the caravan, where it was found
                by my friends. The squash was given a face with a black marker
                and roamed the halls of Cathedral, accompanying our friend
                Jeff to many of his classes.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I remember your escort wagon,&lt;br&gt;
            Fearing for my life in the way back.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason often drove his mother&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Escort_(North_America)&#34;&gt;Ford Escort&lt;/a&gt;
                wagon to school. Yes, it had wood paneling.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                One time when driving with Jason, I ended up in the back, with
                the rear seats flat. Wherever we were headed, there was
                traffic on the road, and Jason decided to try to jump ahead by
                cutting through the parking lots of some strip malls. Jason
                did not know slow, and he did not know gradual stops. He was
                wickedly familar with abrupt cornering, however! By the time
                we got back to the main road, I was lying flat in the back
                with a hand firmly gripping each front head rest.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We went to a Chili Pepper concert.&lt;br&gt;
            Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My first &#34;real&#34; concert was on the 3rd of November, 1991, at
                the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MassMutual_Center&#34;&gt;Springfield Civic Center&lt;/a&gt;.
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam&#34;&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins&#34;&gt;The Smashing Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt; opened for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers&#34;&gt;Red
                Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Pearl Jam was almost unknown at the time, as &#34;Ten&#34; had just
                been released. I think that Jason had known of them before the
                show, but I went in cold. The Smashing Pumpkins were
                supporting &#34;Gish&#34;, and were the strongest draw for me and
                Jason. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were the headliner, touring
                to support the just-released &#34;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&#34;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                It felt as if all three bands were growing up, maturing, and
                finding themselves &amp;mdash; just as Jason and I were also learning
                who we were.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,&lt;br&gt;
            Long before they had their big hit.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                We &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing&#34;&gt;moshed&lt;/a&gt;.
                Things were never violent in the pit, but as the crowd surged,
                my glasses were knocked from my face; landing on the floor. I
                still cannot believe that I found them again and that they
                were undamaged.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We went to college and lived together.&lt;br&gt;
            Didn&#39;t last much past October.&lt;br&gt;
            You were always, &#34;Open the blinds, please!&#34;&lt;br&gt;
            as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I both applied and were accepted, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_decision&#34;&gt;early decision&lt;/a&gt;,
                to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wpi.edu/&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;. We lived together our first year, on the first floor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wpi.edu/about/locations/sanford-riley-hall&#34;&gt;Sanford Riley Hall&lt;/a&gt;.
                WPI was pressed for housing, as our tiny double had previously
                served as a single.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason&#39;s bass amp (later named &#34;Ed&#34;) became part of our wake-up
                routine. My clock radio had a tape deck that could be
                programmed as a scheduled alarm. It also had an auxilliary
                out. The radio was wired to the bass amp, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imqvLToWH7k&#34;&gt;Ministry&#39;s N.W.O.&lt;/a&gt; ready to go.
                We were guaranteed to make our 8AM classes!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Before half the year was up, I swapped rooms with someone else
                on our floor. Small things, like closing the curtains when
                dressing, caused friction.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.&lt;br&gt;
            Made a tape called, &#34;What happens behind closed doors&#34;.&lt;br&gt;
            Back then we were bitter like coffee,&lt;br&gt;
            Playing all night at Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were in a number of bands together, starting with Tintern Abbey. &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/&#34;&gt;Jaded&lt;/a&gt; started
                soon after we arrived at WPI. It was initially Jason, me
                (Aron), and our friend Dan, who lived across the hall. We
                couldn&#39;t bring ourselves to call the band &#34;J.A.D.&#34;, and &#34;Jade&#34;
                was an R&amp;amp;B band at the time. We decided to name Jason&#39;s
                bass amp &#34;Ed&#34;. Jaded was Jason, Aron, Dan, and Ed the bass
                amp.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Brian, another of our friends, joined Jaded for a while, but
                it eventually ended up as a duo: me and Jason. I sang and
                played acoustic guitar. Jason started off playing bass before
                buying an electric drum kit.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason handled all of our recording. We borrowed four-track and
                eight-track cassette recorders from friends until Jason got
                his own.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                In 1993, we &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/behind-closed-doors.shtml&#34;&gt;recorded an album&lt;/a&gt; called
                &#34;What Happens Behind Closed Doors&#34;. The cassette B-side was a
                collection of remixes called &#34;The Bitter Like Coffee
                Sessions&#34;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jaded performed a number of times at WPI and around Worcester,
                but our absolute favorite place was Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe
                (RIP). We would perform for an entire evening at Eleni&#39;s,
                sometimes playing every song we knew twice or even three
                times! By the time we wrapped up and finished our coffees, it
                was early the next day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I got hitched and you were my best man,&lt;br&gt;
            Even though your hair had a skunk tan.&lt;br&gt;
            Your toast was absolutely perfect.&lt;br&gt;
            We saved that bread! It&#39;s somewhere in the basement.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason was the best man at my wedding in 2001. Unfortunately,
                he had a habit of making dramatic hair changes immediately
                before important events. In high school, Jason decided to give
                himself a buzz cut, not realizing that yearbook photos were
                the following week! For my wedding, Jason died his hair black,
                leaving only a single streak of peroxide blonde.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                As the best man, Jason gave a toast at our wedding. With his
                toast, he also gave us toast - perfectly browned and protected
                by a plastic bag. Jason&#39;s toast has been stored with a small
                number of keepsakes, ever since.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And now it&#39;s time to say happy birthday,&lt;br&gt;
            Even though you threw your own party.&lt;br&gt;
            Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,&lt;br&gt;
            you&#39;re forty years old.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;threw himself a party&lt;/a&gt;
                for his 40th birthday.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;Jason&amp;rsquo;s birthday bash/concert&lt;/a&gt;.
We had a fun night in Worcester at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ralphsrockdiner.com&#34;&gt;Ralph&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;
listening to good music and catching up with old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped on-stage and performed
&amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/2014/12/21/happy-birthday-jason-macierowski.html&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;
before Jason&amp;rsquo;s band
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/therustyshovels&#34;&gt;The Rusty Shovels&lt;/a&gt; played their
set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We captured an iPhone recording of my performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LqdCRU9qR4&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to all of The Rusty Shovels for letting me crash their party
and serenade Jason with his birthday song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday, Jason Macierowski!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have started to form this habit of writing songs for birthdays. My friend
&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/ben&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; turned 40, and a song emerged.
His son had a birthday on March 14, so I wrote about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/pie&#34;&gt;pie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I heard that one of my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;closest friends was throwing himself a birthday bash/concert&lt;/a&gt;,
inspiration struck. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written a song with so many
lyrics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason and I have a ton of history. We met our sophmore year at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts)&#34;&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;,
and have remained friends since. We went to college at &lt;a href=&#34;http://wpi.edu&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;
together and were briefly roommates. Our first band, Tintern Abbey, gave him
the &amp;rsquo;tintern&amp;rsquo; moniker he has used ever since. All through college, we were the
core of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded&#34;&gt;jaded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to find a way to express just how much I value our
friendship. This song tells our story and it is my present to Jason for his
fortieth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growing-up&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met just a shade before fifteen,&lt;br&gt;
Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.&lt;br&gt;
Our band was Tintern Abbey.&lt;br&gt;
We had no fans, we played so badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned to drive long before you.&lt;br&gt;
Took my mom&amp;rsquo;s caravan to high school.&lt;br&gt;
I remember your escort wagon,&lt;br&gt;
Fearing for my life in the way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a Chili Pepper concert.&lt;br&gt;
Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.&lt;br&gt;
Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,&lt;br&gt;
Long before they had their big hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to college and lived together.&lt;br&gt;
Didn&amp;rsquo;t last much past October.&lt;br&gt;
You were always, &amp;ldquo;Open the blinds, please!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.&lt;br&gt;
Made a tape called, &amp;ldquo;What happens behind closed doors&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
Back then we were bitter like coffee,&lt;br&gt;
Playing all night at Eleni&amp;rsquo;s Midnight Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got hitched and you were my best man,&lt;br&gt;
Even though your hair had a skunk tan.&lt;br&gt;
Your toast was absolutely perfect.&lt;br&gt;
We saved that bread! It&amp;rsquo;s somewhere in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it&amp;rsquo;s time to say happy birthday,&lt;br&gt;
Even though you threw your own party.&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re forty years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In college, I was part of a band called &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded&#34;&gt;jaded&lt;/a&gt;. We
started off as a trio, were briefly a quartet, but for most of our history
were a duo: &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~aron&#34;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; singing and playing guitar and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://webpages.charter.net/tintern/&#34;&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt; playing either bass or
electronic drums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recorded with Tascam cassette recorders, mastered onto cassette, and have
no playable copies of our first two albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have electronic copies of our final studio album,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/breathe.shtml&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from 1995 and our
remix/live album
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/sister-in-the-corner.shtml&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister in the Corner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
from 1998. Both are now available for download from the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded&#34;&gt;jaded&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins&#34;&gt;My SoundCloud page&lt;/a&gt; also has the complete
&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/sets/jaded-breathe&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/sets/jaded-sister-in-the-corner&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister in the Corner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
albums.&lt;/p&gt;
