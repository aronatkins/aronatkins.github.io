&lt;p&gt;
    In 2014, I wrote a song called &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-happy-birthday-jason-macierowski/&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/a&gt;
    for Jason Macierowski&#39;s 40th birthday. He threw himself a party, I wrote him a
    song and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-growing-up-live/&#34;&gt;performed it live&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Shortly after his 47th birthday, in January of 2022, Jason passed away.
    The Worcester Magazine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worcestermag.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/tinternfest-celebrates-life-worcester-music-superfan-jason-macierowski/9763506002/&#34;&gt;published an
    article&lt;/a&gt;
    this week celebrating Jason&#39;s life, noting that &#34;everyone has a Jason
    story&#34;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Growing Up hints at some of our times together. This annotated version of the
song lyrics shares more of our story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;aronography&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;lyrics&#34;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We met just a shade before fifteen,&lt;br&gt;
            Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I met Jason Macierowski in the fall of 1989, when we were both
                starting our sophmore year at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Cathedral
                High School&lt;/a&gt; in Springfield, Massachusetts. The science
                wing was an extension to the main building, like a
                hitch-hiking thumb stuck onto the middle of the primary
                building&#39;s figure-8.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were part of a group of kids who tended to get to
                school quite a bit before the start of the day. We would get
                breakfast in the cafeteria, swing by our lockers, maybe do some
                homework, and then wander the halls. The science wing was part of
                our loop.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were always surprised that we never met earlier
                than our second year at Cathedral. We had many of the same
                friends and took the same classes our first year, but happened
                to be in different sections of each course. Everything changed
                our sophmore year; together in almost every period.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Our band was Tintern Abbey.&lt;br&gt;
            We had no fans, we played so badly.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The band we formed in high school was called Tintern Abbey.
                Our first performance saw us pelted by oranges thrown by our
                classmates.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                From Tintern Abbey, &lt;a href=&#34;posts/2022-05-17-from-where-came-tintern/&#34;&gt;Jason became &lt;code&gt;tintern@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
                and often used &#34;Tintern&#34; online. It was a frequent enough
                handle that some folks used that tag in person, as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I learned to drive long before you.&lt;br&gt;
            Took my mom&#39;s caravan to high school.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My birthday is in October, Jason&#39;s was December. That sounds
                like our birthdays were close together, but trust me: when
                you&#39;re sixteen waiting for the freedoms that arrive with a
                driver&#39;s license, months drag on forever!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I would sometimes drive my mother&#39;s blue &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager&#34;&gt;Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;
                to school, as I often needed to pick up orders for our store
                from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Pierce&#34;&gt;S.S. Pierce&lt;/a&gt;
                in Springfield.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                One time, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butternut_squash&#34;&gt;butternut squash&lt;/a&gt;
                rolled underneath the seat of the caravan, where it was found
                by my friends. The squash was given a face with a black marker
                and roamed the halls of Cathedral, accompanying our friend
                Jeff to many of his classes.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I remember your escort wagon,&lt;br&gt;
            Fearing for my life in the way back.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason often drove his mother&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Escort_(North_America)&#34;&gt;Ford Escort&lt;/a&gt;
                wagon to school. Yes, it had wood paneling.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                One time when driving with Jason, I ended up in the back, with
                the rear seats flat. Wherever we were headed, there was
                traffic on the road, and Jason decided to try to jump ahead by
                cutting through the parking lots of some strip malls. Jason
                did not know slow, and he did not know gradual stops. He was
                wickedly familar with abrupt cornering, however! By the time
                we got back to the main road, I was lying flat in the back
                with a hand firmly gripping each front head rest.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We went to a Chili Pepper concert.&lt;br&gt;
            Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My first &#34;real&#34; concert was on the 3rd of November, 1991, at
                the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MassMutual_Center&#34;&gt;Springfield Civic Center&lt;/a&gt;.
                &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam&#34;&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins&#34;&gt;The Smashing Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt; opened for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers&#34;&gt;Red
                Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Pearl Jam was almost unknown at the time, as &#34;Ten&#34; had just
                been released. I think that Jason had known of them before the
                show, but I went in cold. The Smashing Pumpkins were
                supporting &#34;Gish&#34;, and were the strongest draw for me and
                Jason. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were the headliner, touring
                to support the just-released &#34;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&#34;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                It felt as if all three bands were growing up, maturing, and
                finding themselves &amp;mdash; just as Jason and I were also learning
                who we were.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,&lt;br&gt;
            Long before they had their big hit.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;       
            &lt;p&gt;
                We &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing&#34;&gt;moshed&lt;/a&gt;.
                Things were never violent in the pit, but as the crowd surged,
                my glasses were knocked from my face; landing on the floor. I
                still cannot believe that I found them again and that they
                were undamaged.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            We went to college and lived together.&lt;br&gt;
            Didn&#39;t last much past October.&lt;br&gt;
            You were always, &#34;Open the blinds, please!&#34;&lt;br&gt;
            as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I both applied and were accepted, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_decision&#34;&gt;early decision&lt;/a&gt;,
                to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wpi.edu/&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;. We lived together our first year, on the first floor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wpi.edu/about/locations/sanford-riley-hall&#34;&gt;Sanford Riley Hall&lt;/a&gt;.
                WPI was pressed for housing, as our tiny double had previously
                served as a single.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason&#39;s bass amp (later named &#34;Ed&#34;) became part of our wake-up
                routine. My clock radio had a tape deck that could be
                programmed as a scheduled alarm. It also had an auxilliary
                out. The radio was wired to the bass amp, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imqvLToWH7k&#34;&gt;Ministry&#39;s N.W.O.&lt;/a&gt; ready to go.
                We were guaranteed to make our 8AM classes!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Before half the year was up, I swapped rooms with someone else
                on our floor. Small things, like closing the curtains when
                dressing, caused friction.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.&lt;br&gt;
            Made a tape called, &#34;What happens behind closed doors&#34;.&lt;br&gt;
            Back then we were bitter like coffee,&lt;br&gt;
            Playing all night at Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason and I were in a number of bands together, starting with Tintern Abbey. &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/&#34;&gt;Jaded&lt;/a&gt; started
                soon after we arrived at WPI. It was initially Jason, me
                (Aron), and our friend Dan, who lived across the hall. We
                couldn&#39;t bring ourselves to call the band &#34;J.A.D.&#34;, and &#34;Jade&#34;
                was an R&amp;amp;B band at the time. We decided to name Jason&#39;s
                bass amp &#34;Ed&#34;. Jaded was Jason, Aron, Dan, and Ed the bass
                amp.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Brian, another of our friends, joined Jaded for a while, but
                it eventually ended up as a duo: me and Jason. I sang and
                played acoustic guitar. Jason started off playing bass before
                buying an electric drum kit.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason handled all of our recording. We borrowed four-track and
                eight-track cassette recorders from friends until Jason got
                his own.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                In 1993, we &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/behind-closed-doors.shtml&#34;&gt;recorded an album&lt;/a&gt; called
                &#34;What Happens Behind Closed Doors&#34;. The cassette B-side was a
                collection of remixes called &#34;The Bitter Like Coffee
                Sessions&#34;.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jaded performed a number of times at WPI and around Worcester,
                but our absolute favorite place was Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe
                (RIP). We would perform for an entire evening at Eleni&#39;s,
                sometimes playing every song we knew twice or even three
                times! By the time we wrapped up and finished our coffees, it
                was early the next day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            I got hitched and you were my best man,&lt;br&gt;
            Even though your hair had a skunk tan.&lt;br&gt;
            Your toast was absolutely perfect.&lt;br&gt;
            We saved that bread! It&#39;s somewhere in the basement.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason was the best man at my wedding in 2001. Unfortunately,
                he had a habit of making dramatic hair changes immediately
                before important events. In high school, Jason decided to give
                himself a buzz cut, not realizing that yearbook photos were
                the following week! For my wedding, Jason died his hair black,
                leaving only a single streak of peroxide blonde.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                As the best man, Jason gave a toast at our wedding. With his
                toast, he also gave us toast - perfectly browned and protected
                by a plastic bag. Jason&#39;s toast has been stored with a small
                number of keepsakes, ever since.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        
        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And now it&#39;s time to say happy birthday,&lt;br&gt;
            Even though you threw your own party.&lt;br&gt;
            Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,&lt;br&gt;
            you&#39;re forty years old.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Jason &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;threw himself a party&lt;/a&gt;
                for his 40th birthday.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;
            And we just keep growing up.
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worcestermag.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/tinternfest-celebrates-life-worcester-music-superfan-jason-macierowski/9763506002/&#34;&gt;Tintern was a man&lt;/a&gt;, Tintern Abbey was a band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started in 1992, during our senior year of high school at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts)&#34;&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.
This was the era of MTV and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120_Minutes&#34;&gt;120
Minutes&lt;/a&gt;. Jason played bass, Sean
was on guitar, Marc had the drums, and I sang and played some guitar. We
always practiced in Marc&amp;rsquo;s basement, as his &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Peart&#34;&gt;Neil
Peart&lt;/a&gt;-inspired drum set wasn&amp;rsquo;t
easily moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Jason proposed the name &amp;ldquo;Tintern Abbey&amp;rdquo;, while flipping through our
English textbook. The Wordsworth poem, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_Written_a_Few_Miles_above_Tintern_Abbey&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lines Written a Few Miles above
Tintern
Abbey&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;,
was part of our curriculum. The poem was accompanied by an image of the abbey,
its structure consumed by nature. The scenery and words spoke to us;
particularly to Jason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tintern Abbey had a short life, but our first performance was memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathedral decided that they would let a couple of student bands perform in
front of the whole school, just before the end of the year. This was a big
deal for that relatively conservative institution. Tintern Abbey and Julie
Sunflower. We played first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew three songs. We started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Louie&#34;&gt;Louie,
Louie&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Thing_(The_Troggs_song)&#34;&gt;Wild
Thing&lt;/a&gt;. Rock &amp;amp;
Roll standards. Three chords each. Basically the same song, played twice.
Things were going well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we started playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit&#34;&gt;Smells Like Teen
Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that this was a lunchtime performance? The entire student body
of Cathedral High School &amp;ndash; well over a thousand kids &amp;ndash; had bagged lunches.
With oranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great singer, but I was an even worse guitar player. As I started
the solo to Smells Like Teen Spirit, the oranges started flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all kept playing. All except Jason, who unstrapped his guitar, held it by
its neck, and started batting oranges back towards the crowd. Smells like teen
spirit, indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tintern Abbey played twice more, focusing more on originals than covers. There
was a summer student retreat near Springfield (sadly, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember its
name), and we performed in their talent show in the summers of 1992 and 1993.
Marc bowed out after high school, with Chris doing most of the drumming. Jeff
would sometimes play keyboards, and Beth occasionally sang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason and I went to WPI together, and were roommates during our first year.
One of the rituals at WPI at that time was signing up for an email address and
Unix login account. On our first day on campus, Jason and I walked down to the
CCC, filled out index card-sized forms, and received our accounts. I was
&lt;code&gt;atkins@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;, he was &lt;code&gt;tintern@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell from our choices, Jason was far more &amp;ldquo;Internet savvy&amp;rdquo;
than me - he had attended the WPI Frontiers program the previous summer and
knew better than to use his name as his login. From that day forward, Jason
was &lt;code&gt;tintern&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tintern Abbey only saw three performances, but &amp;ldquo;Tintern&amp;rdquo; saw many more. He
would love the fact that he is being &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worcestermag.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/tinternfest-celebrates-life-worcester-music-superfan-jason-macierowski/9763506002/&#34;&gt;celebrated in
music&lt;/a&gt;
by those close to him, as &lt;code&gt;tintern&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
