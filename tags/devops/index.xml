      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful transitions I experienced while at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://brightcove.com&#34;&gt;Brightcove&lt;/a&gt; was the shift away from
dev-and-test-and-deploy silos. In its place came teams who built, tested,
deployed, and operated our services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across an
&lt;a href=&#34;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065&#34;&gt;ACM interview&lt;/a&gt; with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com&#34;&gt;Werner Vogels&lt;/a&gt; from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The article is from 2006 but discusses their
experience with this transition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving developers operational responsibilities has greatly enhanced the
quality of the services, both from a customer and a technology point of
view. The traditional model is that you take your software to the wall that
separates development and operations, and throw it over and then forget
about it. Not at Amazon. You build it, you run it. This brings developers
into contact with the day-to-day operation of their software. It also brings
them into day-to-day contact with the customer. This customer feedback loop
is essential for improving the quality of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key building block is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You build it, you run it.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I would prefer
a slightly stronger statement, which is: &amp;ldquo;You build it, you own it.&amp;rdquo; In the
best of worlds, there is no handoff &amp;ndash; the team writing the code is the team
testing the build is the team deploying the service is the team responding to
support requests and is the team paged if something breaks in the middle of
the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ideal that the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps&#34;&gt;devops&lt;/a&gt; movement is trying to
accomplish. There is no wall, no barrier that divides an organization into
separate teams based on skills. Instead, there are blended teams trying to
completely solve some problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving a team ownership of a product motivates those individuals to take
fuller responsibility for their work. They learn more about the problem being
solved. They learn more about constraints placed upon their system (perhaps
business, perhaps technical). There is no one between their output and
your customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take it personally when something I built does not perform as anticipated or
fails to meet some customer need. I take pride in products I deliver; my work
is a reflection of me. I take it as a personal failure if my work makes me
lose a night of sleep, or worse, if I cause someone else to have a rough
night. None of this is discouraging! My defensive reaction drives me to
improve our products further and to be more critical in my own work going
forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen this same behavior in others; ownership that encourages personal
responsibility is a powerful feedback loop that can drive a product team
forward.&lt;/p&gt;
