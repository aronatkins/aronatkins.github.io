      <description>Eight years ago, Matthew and I were busy bootstrapping spotstory. We lived in different towns near Boston and were often looking for places to meet. For months we said, &amp;ldquo;You know, there really should be a website where you can give it two addresses, and it will find all of the coffee shops halfway between them.&amp;rdquo;
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep one night and whipped up a.placebetween.us.
We blogged about some of the early publicity about the site, but the spotstory blog is no more.</description>
