Eight years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;http://matthewbellantoni.com&#34;&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt; and I were busy
bootstrapping spotstory. We lived in different towns near Boston and were
often looking for places to meet. For months we said, &amp;ldquo;You know, there really
should be a website where you can give it two addresses, and it will find all
of the coffee shops halfway between them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep one night and whipped up
&lt;a href=&#34;http://a.placebetween.us&#34;&gt;a.placebetween.us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We blogged about some of the early publicity about the site, but the spotstory
blog is no more. Luckily, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org&#34;&gt;web archive&lt;/a&gt; appears to
have everything, ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to link to some of those
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070712094926/http://blog.spotstory.com/&#34;&gt;old blog posts&lt;/a&gt;
because they&amp;rsquo;re impossible to find if you&amp;rsquo;re not looking carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080905125344/http://blog.spotstory.com/2007/05/10/introducing-aplacebetweenus/&#34;&gt;Introducing a.placebetween.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080905125344/http://blog.spotstory.com/2007/05/13/weekend-mentions-roundup/&#34;&gt;Weekend Mentions Roundup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080905125344/http://blog.spotstory.com/2007/05/14/aplacebetweenus-on/&#34;&gt;a.placebetween.us on del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080905125344/http://blog.spotstory.com/2007/05/14/anupdatefromus/&#34;&gt;an.updatefrom.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080905125344/http://blog.spotstory.com/2007/05/16/aplacebetweenus-on-yahoo-tvs-the-9-and-more/&#34;&gt;a.placebetween.us on Yahoo! TVâ€™s The 9, and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080905125344/http://blog.spotstory.com/2007/06/01/aplacebetweenacrowd/&#34;&gt;a.placebetween.a.crowd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really quite a simple site &amp;ndash; just one HTML page and some Javascript.
Google&amp;rsquo;s Map and Search APIs do all the heavy lifting. Everything is almost
the same as it was when we wrote it eight years ago. I did an update about a
year ago beause Google changed their APIs, but otherwise, what you&amp;rsquo;re seeing
is 2007 code. Lovely, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still receive the occasional email thanking us for building
&lt;a href=&#34;http://a.placebetween.us&#34;&gt;a.placebetween.us&lt;/a&gt;. We built it for ourselves a
long time ago and are pleased as punch that others are still finding it
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was our midpoint way back then? The Panera Bread in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watertown_Arsenal&#34;&gt;Watertown Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; was pretty
close!&lt;/p&gt;
