      <description>We recently purchased the Jewelbots Wearables Kit 1.0 and built this lovely felt &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rdquo; that is soon getting attached to a backpack.
I have been a software engineer for twenty years, but never did much with hardware and electronics. The Jewelbots kit is a good entry to this world.
In the kit The Jewelbots WearablesKit contains:
 An Arduino Gemma Five Adafruit LED sequins Conductive thread Battery holder Two cell batteries Sewing needles  Jewelbots uses Adafruit parts to build their kit, which retails for $29 and comes in a branded box, stickers and a small instruction booklet.</description>
