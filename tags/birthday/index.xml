      <description>Another in my series of birthday songs. This was inspired by a &amp;ldquo;Jake and the Neverland Pirates&amp;rdquo; seventh birthday party theme.
  Birthday Party Pirates I want to be a pirate
Headed out to sea.
I just turned seven
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I am ready!
I want to be a pirate
Maybe first mate.
Don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a scallywag
Who&amp;rsquo;s forced to walk the plank!
Yo, ho, ho!</description>

      <description>Another birthday, another song. Last year, I wrote &amp;ldquo;Ben&amp;rdquo;. This year is not much different, as I wrote a song about maggots again. We debuted the song last night at Ben&amp;rsquo;s birthday party (with kids dancing and singing the &amp;ldquo;All for one!&amp;rdquo; maggot parts). It sounds so much better with a chorus of kids!
  The Maggots Rise Again The last time we talked, I asked about your maggots, Ben.</description>

      <description>Last night was Jason&amp;rsquo;s birthday bash/concert. We had a fun night in Worcester at Ralph&amp;rsquo;s listening to good music and catching up with old friends.
I jumped on-stage and performed &amp;lsquo;Growing Up&amp;lsquo; before Jason&amp;rsquo;s band The Rusty Shovels played their set.
We captured an iPhone recording of my performance.

Thanks so much to all of The Rusty Shovels for letting me crash their party and serenade Jason with his birthday song.</description>

      <description>I have started to form this habit of writing songs for birthdays. My friend Ben turned 40, and a song emerged. His son had a birthday on March 14, so I wrote about pie.
As soon as I heard that one of my closest friends was throwing himself a birthday bash/concert, inspiration struck. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written a song with so many lyrics!
Jason and I have a ton of history.</description>
