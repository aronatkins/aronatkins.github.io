      <description>&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;    In 2014, I wrote a song called &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-happy-birthday-jason-macierowski/&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    for Jason Macierowski&#39;s 40th birthday. He threw himself a party, I wrote him a&#xA;    song and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/posts/2014-12-21-growing-up-live/&#34;&gt;performed it live&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;    Shortly after his 47th birthday, in January of 2022, Jason passed away.&#xA;    The Worcester Magazine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worcestermag.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/tinternfest-celebrates-life-worcester-music-superfan-jason-macierowski/9763506002/&#34;&gt;published an&#xA;    article&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    this week celebrating Jason&#39;s life, noting that &#34;everyone has a Jason&#xA;    story&#34;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;Growing Up hints at some of our times together. This annotated version of the&#xA;song lyrics shares more of our story.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;aronography&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;lyrics&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            We met just a shade before fifteen,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                I met Jason Macierowski in the fall of 1989, when we were both&#xA;                starting our sophmore year at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts&#34;&gt;Cathedral&#xA;                High School&lt;/a&gt; in Springfield, Massachusetts. The science&#xA;                wing was an extension to the main building, like a&#xA;                hitch-hiking thumb stuck onto the middle of the primary&#xA;                building&#39;s figure-8.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason and I were part of a group of kids who tended to get to&#xA;                school quite a bit before the start of the day. We would get&#xA;                breakfast in the cafeteria, swing by our lockers, maybe do some&#xA;                homework, and then wander the halls. The science wing was part of&#xA;                our loop.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason and I were always surprised that we never met earlier&#xA;                than our second year at Cathedral. We had many of the same&#xA;                friends and took the same classes our first year, but happened&#xA;                to be in different sections of each course. Everything changed&#xA;                our sophmore year; together in almost every period.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Our band was Tintern Abbey.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            We had no fans, we played so badly.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                The band we formed in high school was called Tintern Abbey.&#xA;                Our first performance saw us pelted by oranges thrown by our&#xA;                classmates.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                From Tintern Abbey, &lt;a href=&#34;posts/2022-05-17-from-where-came-tintern/&#34;&gt;Jason became &lt;code&gt;tintern@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;                and often used &#34;Tintern&#34; online. It was a frequent enough&#xA;                handle that some folks used that tag in person, as well.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And we just keep growing up.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            I learned to drive long before you.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Took my mom&#39;s caravan to high school.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                My birthday is in October, Jason&#39;s was December. That sounds&#xA;                like our birthdays were close together, but trust me: when&#xA;                you&#39;re sixteen waiting for the freedoms that arrive with a&#xA;                driver&#39;s license, months drag on forever!&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                I would sometimes drive my mother&#39;s blue &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager&#34;&gt;Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;                to school, as I often needed to pick up orders for our store&#xA;                from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Pierce&#34;&gt;S.S. Pierce&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;                in Springfield.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                One time, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butternut_squash&#34;&gt;butternut squash&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;                rolled underneath the seat of the caravan, where it was found&#xA;                by my friends. The squash was given a face with a black marker&#xA;                and roamed the halls of Cathedral, accompanying our friend&#xA;                Jeff to many of his classes.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            I remember your escort wagon,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Fearing for my life in the way back.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason often drove his mother&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Escort_(North_America)&#34;&gt;Ford Escort&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;                wagon to school. Yes, it had wood paneling.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                One time when driving with Jason, I ended up in the back, with&#xA;                the rear seats flat. Wherever we were headed, there was&#xA;                traffic on the road, and Jason decided to try to jump ahead by&#xA;                cutting through the parking lots of some strip malls. Jason&#xA;                did not know slow, and he did not know gradual stops. He was&#xA;                wickedly familar with abrupt cornering, however! By the time&#xA;                we got back to the main road, I was lying flat in the back&#xA;                with a hand firmly gripping each front head rest.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And we just keep growing up.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            We went to a Chili Pepper concert.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                My first &#34;real&#34; concert was on the 3rd of November, 1991, at&#xA;                the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MassMutual_Center&#34;&gt;Springfield Civic Center&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;                &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam&#34;&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins&#34;&gt;The Smashing Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt; opened for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers&#34;&gt;Red&#xA;                Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Pearl Jam was almost unknown at the time, as &#34;Ten&#34; had just&#xA;                been released. I think that Jason had known of them before the&#xA;                show, but I went in cold. The Smashing Pumpkins were&#xA;                supporting &#34;Gish&#34;, and were the strongest draw for me and&#xA;                Jason. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were the headliner, touring&#xA;                to support the just-released &#34;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&#34;.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                It felt as if all three bands were growing up, maturing, and&#xA;                finding themselves &amp;mdash; just as Jason and I were also learning&#xA;                who we were.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Long before they had their big hit.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                We &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing&#34;&gt;moshed&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;                Things were never violent in the pit, but as the crowd surged,&#xA;                my glasses were knocked from my face; landing on the floor. I&#xA;                still cannot believe that I found them again and that they&#xA;                were undamaged.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And we just keep growing up.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            We went to college and lived together.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Didn&#39;t last much past October.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            You were always, &#34;Open the blinds, please!&#34;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason and I both applied and were accepted, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_decision&#34;&gt;early decision&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;                to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wpi.edu/&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;. We lived together our first year, on the first floor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wpi.edu/about/locations/sanford-riley-hall&#34;&gt;Sanford Riley Hall&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;                WPI was pressed for housing, as our tiny double had previously&#xA;                served as a single.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason&#39;s bass amp (later named &#34;Ed&#34;) became part of our wake-up&#xA;                routine. My clock radio had a tape deck that could be&#xA;                programmed as a scheduled alarm. It also had an auxilliary&#xA;                out. The radio was wired to the bass amp, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imqvLToWH7k&#34;&gt;Ministry&#39;s N.W.O.&lt;/a&gt; ready to go.&#xA;                We were guaranteed to make our 8AM classes!&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Before half the year was up, I swapped rooms with someone else&#xA;                on our floor. Small things, like closing the curtains when&#xA;                dressing, caused friction.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And we just keep growing up.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Made a tape called, &#34;What happens behind closed doors&#34;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Back then we were bitter like coffee,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Playing all night at Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason and I were in a number of bands together, starting with Tintern Abbey. &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/&#34;&gt;Jaded&lt;/a&gt; started&#xA;                soon after we arrived at WPI. It was initially Jason, me&#xA;                (Aron), and our friend Dan, who lived across the hall. We&#xA;                couldn&#39;t bring ourselves to call the band &#34;J.A.D.&#34;, and &#34;Jade&#34;&#xA;                was an R&amp;amp;B band at the time. We decided to name Jason&#39;s&#xA;                bass amp &#34;Ed&#34;. Jaded was Jason, Aron, Dan, and Ed the bass&#xA;                amp.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Brian, another of our friends, joined Jaded for a while, but&#xA;                it eventually ended up as a duo: me and Jason. I sang and&#xA;                played acoustic guitar. Jason started off playing bass before&#xA;                buying an electric drum kit.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason handled all of our recording. We borrowed four-track and&#xA;                eight-track cassette recorders from friends until Jason got&#xA;                his own.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                In 1993, we &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded/behind-closed-doors.shtml&#34;&gt;recorded an album&lt;/a&gt; called&#xA;                &#34;What Happens Behind Closed Doors&#34;. The cassette B-side was a&#xA;                collection of remixes called &#34;The Bitter Like Coffee&#xA;                Sessions&#34;.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jaded performed a number of times at WPI and around Worcester,&#xA;                but our absolute favorite place was Eleni&#39;s Midnight Cafe&#xA;                (RIP). We would perform for an entire evening at Eleni&#39;s,&#xA;                sometimes playing every song we knew twice or even three&#xA;                times! By the time we wrapped up and finished our coffees, it&#xA;                was early the next day.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And we just keep growing up.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            I got hitched and you were my best man,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Even though your hair had a skunk tan.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Your toast was absolutely perfect.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            We saved that bread! It&#39;s somewhere in the basement.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason was the best man at my wedding in 2001. Unfortunately,&#xA;                he had a habit of making dramatic hair changes immediately&#xA;                before important events. In high school, Jason decided to give&#xA;                himself a buzz cut, not realizing that yearbook photos were&#xA;                the following week! For my wedding, Jason died his hair black,&#xA;                leaving only a single streak of peroxide blonde.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                As the best man, Jason gave a toast at our wedding. With his&#xA;                toast, he also gave us toast - perfectly browned and protected&#xA;                by a plastic bag. Jason&#39;s toast has been stored with a small&#xA;                number of keepsakes, ever since.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And we just keep growing up.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And now it&#39;s time to say happy birthday,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Even though you threw your own party.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;            you&#39;re forty years old.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;blockquote class=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&#xA;                Jason &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;threw himself a party&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;                for his 40th birthday.&#xA;            &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;verse&#34;&gt;&#xA;            And we just keep growing up.&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;</description>

Jason played bass, Sean&#xA;was on guitar, Marc had the drums, and I sang and played some guitar. We&#xA;always practiced in Marc&amp;rsquo;s basement, as his &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Peart&#34;&gt;Neil&#xA;Peart&lt;/a&gt;-inspired drum set wasn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;easily moved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think Jason proposed the name &amp;ldquo;Tintern Abbey&amp;rdquo;, while flipping through our&#xA;English textbook. The Wordsworth poem, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_Written_a_Few_Miles_above_Tintern_Abbey&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lines Written a Few Miles above&#xA;Tintern&#xA;Abbey&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;was part of our curriculum. The poem was accompanied by an image of the abbey,&#xA;its structure consumed by nature. The scenery and words spoke to us;&#xA;particularly to Jason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tintern Abbey had a short life, but our first performance was memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cathedral decided that they would let a couple of student bands perform in&#xA;front of the whole school, just before the end of the year. This was a big&#xA;deal for that relatively conservative institution. Tintern Abbey and Julie&#xA;Sunflower. We played first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We knew three songs. We started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Louie&#34;&gt;Louie,&#xA;Louie&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Thing_(The_Troggs_song)&#34;&gt;Wild&#xA;Thing&lt;/a&gt;. Rock &amp;amp;&#xA;Roll standards. Three chords each. Basically the same song, played twice.&#xA;Things were going well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then we started playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit&#34;&gt;Smells Like Teen&#xA;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that this was a lunchtime performance? The entire student body&#xA;of Cathedral High School &amp;ndash; well over a thousand kids &amp;ndash; had bagged lunches.&#xA;With oranges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great singer, but I was an even worse guitar player. As I started&#xA;the solo to Smells Like Teen Spirit, the oranges started flying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We all kept playing. All except Jason, who unstrapped his guitar, held it by&#xA;its neck, and started batting oranges back towards the crowd. Smells like teen&#xA;spirit, indeed!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tintern Abbey played twice more, focusing more on originals than covers. There&#xA;was a summer student retreat near Springfield (sadly, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember its&#xA;name), and we performed in their talent show in the summers of 1992 and 1993.&#xA;Marc bowed out after high school, with Chris doing most of the drumming. Jeff&#xA;would sometimes play keyboards, and Beth occasionally sang.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jason and I went to WPI together, and were roommates during our first year.&#xA;One of the rituals at WPI at that time was signing up for an email address and&#xA;Unix login account. On our first day on campus, Jason and I walked down to the&#xA;CCC, filled out index card-sized forms, and received our accounts. I was&#xA;&lt;code&gt;atkins@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;, he was &lt;code&gt;tintern@wpi.edu&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell from our choices, Jason was far more &amp;ldquo;Internet savvy&amp;rdquo;&#xA;than me - he had attended the WPI Frontiers program the previous summer and&#xA;knew better than to use his name as his login. From that day forward, Jason&#xA;was &lt;code&gt;tintern&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tintern Abbey only saw three performances, but &amp;ldquo;Tintern&amp;rdquo; saw many more. He&#xA;would love the fact that he is being &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worcestermag.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/tinternfest-celebrates-life-worcester-music-superfan-jason-macierowski/9763506002/&#34;&gt;celebrated in&#xA;music&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;by those close to him, as &lt;code&gt;tintern&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img height = &#34;200px&#34; src=&#34;https://aronatkins.github.io/images/crop-old0013.jpg&#34;&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have started to form this habit of writing songs for birthdays. My friend&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/ben&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; turned 40, and a song emerged.&#xA;His son had a birthday on March 14, so I wrote about&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aronatkins/pie&#34;&gt;pie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I heard that one of my&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegram.com/article/20141218/NEWS/312189980/0/SEARCH&#34;&gt;closest friends was throwing himself a birthday bash/concert&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;inspiration struck. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written a song with so many&#xA;lyrics!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jason and I have a ton of history. We met our sophmore year at&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_High_School_(Springfield%2C_Massachusetts)&#34;&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and have remained friends since. We went to college at &lt;a href=&#34;http://wpi.edu&#34;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;together and were briefly roommates. Our first band, Tintern Abbey, gave him&#xA;the &amp;rsquo;tintern&amp;rsquo; moniker he has used ever since. All through college, we were the&#xA;core of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gweep.net/~jaded&#34;&gt;jaded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to find a way to express just how much I value our&#xA;friendship. This song tells our story and it is my present to Jason for his&#xA;fortieth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/182189210%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ekY6z&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;growing-up&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We met just a shade before fifteen,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fast friends hanging out in the science wing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Our band was Tintern Abbey.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We had no fans, we played so badly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned to drive long before you.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Took my mom&amp;rsquo;s caravan to high school.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I remember your escort wagon,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fearing for my life in the way back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went to a Chili Pepper concert.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Pearl Jam and the pumpkins were a great start.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Almost lost my glasses in the mosh pit,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Long before they had their big hit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went to college and lived together.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Didn&amp;rsquo;t last much past October.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You were always, &amp;ldquo;Open the blinds, please!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;as you streaked through the rain in your white briefs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shared a girlfriend, maybe three or four.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Made a tape called, &amp;ldquo;What happens behind closed doors&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Back then we were bitter like coffee,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Playing all night at Eleni&amp;rsquo;s Midnight Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got hitched and you were my best man,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Even though your hair had a skunk tan.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Your toast was absolutely perfect.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We saved that bread! It&amp;rsquo;s somewhere in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now it&amp;rsquo;s time to say happy birthday,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Even though you threw your own party.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Happy birthday, Jason Macierowski,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;you&amp;rsquo;re forty years old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we just keep growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>
