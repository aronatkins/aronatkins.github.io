      <description>Last night was Jason&amp;rsquo;s birthday bash/concert. We had a fun night in Worcester at Ralph&amp;rsquo;s listening to good music and catching up with old friends.
I jumped on-stage and performed &amp;lsquo;Growing Up&amp;lsquo; before Jason&amp;rsquo;s band The Rusty Shovels played their set.
We captured an iPhone recording of my performance.

Thanks so much to all of The Rusty Shovels for letting me crash their party and serenade Jason with his birthday song.</description>

      <description>I have started to form this habit of writing songs for birthdays. My friend Ben turned 40, and a song emerged. His son had a birthday on March 14, so I wrote about pie.
As soon as I heard that one of my closest friends was throwing himself a birthday bash/concert, inspiration struck. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written a song with so many lyrics!
Jason and I have a ton of history.</description>
